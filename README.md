# What now ?! (*WIP*)

"What now ?!" is (well, will be) an out of the box working gem built to help your products reviewers... review your product.
Being a reviewer, you just have to click on elements on the website and add your questions/comments and allow people to reply until the point is marked as resolved.

## Installation

**TODO**

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'whatnow'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install whatnow

## Usage

**TODO**

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
